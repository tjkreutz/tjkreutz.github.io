I will probably remove this post, but since I have nothing else to write, here is the proper way to introduce it to the world. echo "Hello World!". It actually needs to be long enough as to fit as an excerpt. But I think I can manage. Next steps will be to finetune the design of the blog. It is a bit bland still. And implement that wonderfully simple comment system that I have in mind. Now though, I should push it to a github page.
