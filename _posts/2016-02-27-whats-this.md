This is an attempt at a programming/personal interest blog by me, Tim Kreutz, to document some of the things I do for later reference. It hopefully will also serve as a tool to make me want to finish [my humble undertakings](http://timkreutz.nl/musicmood/) as opposed to adding them to my [“pile of unfinished projects”](http://timkreutz.nl/soepvandedag/). Its objective is thus of a selfish nature and the only reason it is made public at all, is to reinforce the idea that it actually matters what I write, and, in the off case that it may actually help or entertain someone, to interact with readers.

In the latter case, please leave a comment or connect to me through one of the social tools I use: [![Bitbucket Icon]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/icon-bitbucket.png "Bitbucket")/tjkreutz](https://bitbucket.org/tjkreutz/), [![Github Icon]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/icon-github.png "Github")/tjkreutz](https://github.com/tjkreutz), [![Twitter Icon]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/icon-twitter.png "Twitter")@tjkreutz](https://twitter.com/tjkreutz), [![Google Plus Icon]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/icon-googleplus.png "Google+")tjkreutz](https://plus.google.com/+tjkreutz).
