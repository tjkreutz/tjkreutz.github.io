Whenever I discuss study programmes with fellow students it becomes apparent what a choice-obsessed society we really are. We believe that there is nothing more important than making the 'right' choice, which presupposes that the is a right choice to begin with. Typical catch-phrases include 'I really made the right choice', 'I have really found my place', or 'it wasn't a good fit', 'it turned out to not be my thing'. 

I am not saying that in some cases it can happen that a study programme itself does not live up to your expectations, but empirically (small sample size, mind you) I have found it has more to do with timing than anything else. When, in your life, are you willing to bear down and take the bad with the good?

Finding your place has more to do with how successful you turn out to be in your respective programme, but that is (at least partly) up to you. A better focus than to look for signs of your choice being right or wrong, is to aim high and ask yourself: "If I really give this my best shot, where could I end up?" Most likely you will end up with an image of your future self that can persevere a few poorly taught courses.

For me, I started Information Science with a target in mind: to work for Google. Four years ago the reasons for it were very obscure and my view of Google as a company has become more realistic over the course of my studies. Although reasons changed the image of myself as a Googler is still going strong.

So when I chaired the study association's travel committee this year and we set our sights on Dublin, getting to Google became my personal goal. As it turns out, the European HQ does not just allow any group to tour their offices, and I met with quite a few dead ends. It was actually when I was beginning to believe I had used up my last leads that an Information Science alumnus put me in contact with a very accommodating colleague in Dublin who arranged the whole thing.

More than our visit just being incredibly cool, and receiving a lot of positive feedback from the group, this was an incredibly valuable experience for me. First, it was mostly daunting. The people who showed us around were unquestionably talented and enthusiastic. They told us about the interviewing process and that discourages you in a way.

But once that experience settles you change your perspective. First, the people you just met were unquestionably talented and enthusiastic, if anything that is another reason to push for this goal; you want to surround yourself with these people. And second: the people I met were more experienced. Maybe I don't see myself surviving the Google hiring process just right now, but using their tips and setting active goals to get to that level in a few years is incredibly helpful. 

You can then only conclude one thing. I am a few steps closer to being a Google employee than a person who did not get to visit Google Dublin.
