title: "What's this?"
---

This is an attempt at a programming/personal interest blog by me, Tim Kreutz, to document some of the things I do for later reference. It hopefully will also serve as a tool to make me want to finish my humble undertakings as opposed to adding them to my pile of unfinished project. Its objective is thus of a selfish nature and the only reason it is made public at all, is to reinforce the idea that it actually matters what I write, and, in the off case that it may actually help or entertain someone, to interact with readers.

In the latter case, please leave a comment or connect to me through one of the social tools I use: [![Github Icon]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/icon-github.png "Github")/tjkreutz](https://github.com/tjkreutz), [![Twitter Icon]({{ site.baseurl}}/img/icon-twitter.png "Twitter")@tjkreutz](https://twitter.com/tjkreutz)).
