description: I want to make this for you so bad! It always gives me a smile. But it is kind of a guilty pleasure and I don't think it is so healthy (though the cabbage is), so maybe once per year? Summer is a good time for it. 
recipeIngredient:
  canned tuna in oil: 1 (about 160g)
  whole grain wraps: 4 (or 6 when smaller)
  white or pointed cabbage: 300g (after cutting)
  sour apple: 2
  red onion: 1
  parsley: 15g
  old dutch cheese: 100g
  mayonnaise: 4tbsp
  white wine vinegar: half a tbsp
recipeInstruction:
  - Cut the onion very finely. Cut the apple in half centimer cubes.
  - Drain the tuna and put it in a bowl. Mix with the onion, half the mayonnaise, half the apple and some pepper.
  - Fold the tuna mixture and a littl bit of cheese into every wrap.
  - Fry the wraps in a grilling pan for 5 minutes on each side, flipping once midway through.
  - Make the salad in the meantime, mixing the cabbage, rest of the apple, mayonnaise, parsley and vinegar.
  - Serve the salad next to the wraps and enjoy.
