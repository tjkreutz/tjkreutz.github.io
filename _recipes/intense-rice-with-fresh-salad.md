description: In the first student flat that I lived there was this guy named Felix. And Felix was... interesting ðŸ˜œ He was a walking encyclopedia of tv shows, knowing all the actors, directors, origins of jokes, backstage trivia, just insane. I took his series recommendations as religion, and he started taking a liking to me. So, after a few months, I joined the "Acht Zuid Kookgroep" (8th floor, south hallway, cooking group). We'd eat together every day and rotate who cooked the meal. It was really ideal for me, because I would eat good food every day, and have to cook only once per week. And everyone had their specialty. I'd usually take care of the Italian dishes. Felix' stuff was more onorthodox. Intense Rice is the most memorable.
recipeIngredient:
  brown rice: 300g
  chicken breast or thigh: 200g
  cajun spice mix: 6tbsp
  old dutch cheese: 100g
  yellow onion: 1
  lamb's lettuce: 200g
  tangerines: 3
  yoghurt dressing: 20ml
recipeInstruction:
  - Cook the rice a little shorter then usual. Then spread it out as thinly as possible on a baking tray.
  - Bake it in the oven at 150Â°C for +- 20 minutes.
  - Cut the chicken into blocks and bake in a frying pan with the onion until lightly browned. 
  - Season the chicken and onion with half the cajun mix.
  - Set the chicken and onions mixture apart on paper towels and remove all fluids from the pan.
  - Add a tiny drop of oil to the frying pan and fry the rice with the rest of the cajun mix on high heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
  - Add the chicken and onions back to the pan and mix with the rice. Stir on low heat for another 10 minutes, depending on how done you chicken is.
  - In the meantime prepare the salad, mixing the lettuce, tangerine parts and yoghurt dressing thoroughly.
  - Serve the rice on plates, covering completely with the Dutch cheese and salad on the side. 
  - (Optionally) drink brown beer.
