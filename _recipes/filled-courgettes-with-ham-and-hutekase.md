description: What if flammkuchen was a vegetable? ü§î I am sure that with the many toppings you have already tried on the dough, you can also experiment with this recipe. It's great how it can vary from very healthy (not a lot of cheese on top) to guilty pleasure (moooore cheese). And it mixes Dutch with German.
recipeIngredient:
  courgettes: 2
  yellow onion: 1
  olive oil: 2tbsp
  ham cubes: 100g
  parsley: 20g
  h√ºttenk√§se: 100g
  old dutch cheese (or similar; grated): 100g 
recipeInstruction:
  - Preheat the oven at 220¬∞C.
  - Cut the courgettes in half (length-wise) and hollow them out with a spoon, leaving about 1,5cm thickness on all sides.
  - Cut the onion and courgette pulp into small pieces and mix.
  - Bake the mixture in the oil on low heat for ca. 5 minutes. Add the ham cubes in the last minute.
  - Sprinkle plenty of salt and pepper on the inside of the halved courgettes.
  - Mix the h√ºttenk√§se with half of the Dutch cheese, shredded parsley and the pulp mixture.
  - Fill the courgette with the mixture and top with the rest of the cheese.
  - Put the courgettes in the oven with a tiny sprinkle of olive oil.
  - Bake the from 25 minutes or until golden brown on top.
