description: This is not really a "family recipe" (we're not Greek), but it's as close as it gets because it's been my favorite soup as long as I remember ðŸ˜‹ This and my moms spaghetti for some reason I can eat twice as much as other dishes. Great for when you're sick or just making food for a party. Everyone loves it and you can easily make it for 8-10 people (if you have a large enough pot).
