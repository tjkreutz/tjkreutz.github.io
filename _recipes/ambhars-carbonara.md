recipeIngredient: 
  spaghetti, linguine or tagliatelle: 300g
  pancetta or similar: 100g
  eggs: 2
  parmezan cheese: 100g
  black pepper: 2tbsp
recipeInstruction:
  - Boil unsalted water and add the spaghetti.
  - Bake the pancetta in a frying pan without butter or oil. If there is too much fat coming out, add some of the boiling water to evaporate the fat.
  - When the spaghetti is al dente, add it to the pan with the pancetta along with about 50ml of starchy water. Kill the fire and mix them thoroughly.
  - Crack the two eggs in a bowl and stir together with most of the cheese and pepper.
  - Add the egg slurry to the pan and stir so that the egg doesn't clot. It should become a smooth sauce.
  - Now add pepper to taste.
  - Serve with more parmezan (and optional salad).
